The method of remainders is improved version to euclidean algorithm and reduces time complexity.
It is the most effecient way of calculating GCD of two numbers.
Given two numbers, If GCD is equal to one they they are said to be Coprime numbers.

Algorithm:
// Given 'a' and 'b' are two numbers, remainder is equal to a divide by 'b'
// If remainder is zero, then return 'b'
// Replace 'a' by 'b' and then 'b' by remainder
// repeat above steps until remainder is zero
// If returned value of 'b' is one they the numbers are said to be Coprime numbers
